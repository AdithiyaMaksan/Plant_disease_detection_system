# Plant Disease Detection Project Report

## 1. Introduction

The Plant Disease Detection project is an AI-powered system designed to help farmers and gardeners identify plant diseases quickly and accurately. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system analyzes images of plant leaves and identifies various diseases affecting different plant species. Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for effective crop management and can significantly reduce crop losses, minimize pesticide usage, and increase agricultural productivity.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Dataset

The project utilizes the Plant Village dataset, which contains thousands of images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across various crop species. The dataset includes 39 different classes representing various plant diseases and healthy plants. The images are organized into folders based on their respective classes.

### 2.2 Model Architecture

#### 2.2.1 Original CNN Model

The original model implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Four blocks of convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32 → 64 → 128 → 256)
- **Each Convolutional Block**:
  - Two convolutional layers with 3×3 kernels and padding
  - ReLU activation functions
  - Batch normalization for faster convergence and stability
  - Max pooling with a 2×2 window for downsampling
- **Dense Layers**:
  - Flattening the output from convolutional layers
  - Dropout (0.4) for regularization
  - A fully connected layer with 1024 neurons and ReLU activation
  - Another dropout layer (0.4)
  - Output layer with 39 neurons (one for each class)

```python
class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, K):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv_layers = nn.Sequential(
            # conv1
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
            nn.Conv2d(in_channels=32, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
            # conv2, conv3, conv4 follow similar pattern with increasing filters
            # ...
        )

        self.dense_layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Dropout(0.4),
            nn.Linear(50176, 1024),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.4),
            nn.Linear(1024, K),
        )
```

#### 2.2.2 Improved Model with Transfer Learning

The improved model leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 network:

- **Base Model**: VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Feature Extraction**: Early convolutional layers are frozen to preserve learned features

  - A fully connected layer with 1024 neurons and ReLU activation
  - Dropout (0.5) for regularization
  - A hidden layer with 512 neurons and ReLU activation
  - Another dropout layer (0.4)
  - Output layer with neurons matching the number of classes

```python
def create_transfer_model(num_classes):
    model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
    
    # Freeze early layers
    for param in model.features[:20].parameters():
        param.requires_grad = False
    
    # Modify classifier
    n_features = model.classifier[0].in_features
    model.classifier = nn.Sequential(
        nn.Linear(n_features, 1024),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Dropout(0.5),
        nn.Linear(1024, 512),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Dropout(0.4),
        nn.Linear(512, num_classes)
    )
    
    return model
```

    output = model(input_data)
    output_np = output.detach().numpy()
    index = np.argmax(output_np)
    
    # Calculate prediction accuracy/confidence
    softmax_output = torch.nn.functional.softmax(output, dim=1).detach().numpy()[0]
